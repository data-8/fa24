# **Frequently Asked Questions**

<br>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Q: What is the best way to get help in this course?</strong></summary>
  <p>A: Your best avenues are to go to office hours held by the course staff, or to ask questions on Ed. Course staff will be monitoring Ed frequently and will try to answer your question quickly and thoroughly.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Q: Where will our grades for assignments be displayed for the course?</strong></summary>
  <p>A: Grades will be displayed on Gradescope for the written and autograded portions for all assignments (homeworks, labs, projects, and exams). For homeworks and projects, your total grade is the sum of the autograded portion and the written portion.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Q: I passed all the tests when doing my homework/project, but still got points off on the autograded portion of the assignment. Why is this happening?</strong></summary>
  <p>A: The homeworks and projects have hidden tests that are not visible to students while they do the assignment. In order to pass these hidden tests, you must test your code yourself and make sure your answer is correct. Our tests are not always comprehensive.</p>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Q: I have a 0 on Gradescope for a lab that I attended and got checked off. Why is this?</strong></summary>
  <p>A: Your attendance may have been marked incorrectly. Please contact your lab TA.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Q: I worked with a partner on a project, and they have a grade on Gradescope for the project while I do not. Why is this happening?</strong></summary>
  <p>A: You were likely not added to the Gradescope submission. Have your partner add you to both the written work and autograder submission immediately and contact your lab TA.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Q: I noticed a mistake in the grading of the written portion of my homework. How can I get this fixed?</strong></summary>
  <p>A: To get this fixed, you must submit a regrade request via Gradescope before the regrade deadline. This is known as the regrade request window. We unfortunately will not accept any regrades after the window has closed. All regrade deadline dates are posted on the same Ed post that releases the assignment grades and solutions.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Q: I have some other grading questions. Who should I contact?</strong></summary>
  <p>A: Please contact your lab GSI.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Q: I would like to apply for a (u)GSI position for this course. What should I do?</strong></summary>
  <p>A: All applications for Academic Student Employee positions are managed centrally; you can find all the details <a href="https://cdss.berkeley.edu/dsus/student-opportunities/joining-data-course-staff" target="_blank">here</a>. Please do not email the instructors individually with your resume/etc, as they are not in a position to hire you.</p>
