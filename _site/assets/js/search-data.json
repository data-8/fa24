    "title": "Cells and the Autograder",
    "content": "Why does running a particular cell cause my kernel to die? . If one particular cell seems to cause your kernel to die, your code is probably incorrect in a way that is causing the computer to use more memory than it has available. For instance: your code is trying to create a gigantic array. To prevent from crashing the entire server, the kernel will “die”. This is an indication that there is a mistake in your code that you need to fix. My python code cell has turned into a text/markdown cell. How do I change it back? . Click on the cell and select Run &gt; Cell Type &gt; Change to Code Cell Type in the top toolbar. How do I quickly run all the cells in a notebook? . Go to the Cell menu in the top toolbar, then “Run All.” You can also select a certain cell and run all cells before this point, or run all cells after this point. You should run all the cells in your notebook before submitting to confirm that you pass all the tests. Why does grader.check_all() fail, if all previous tests passed? . This can happen if you “overwrite” a variable that is used in a question. For instance, if Question 1 asks you to store your answer in a variable named stat, and later on in the notebook you change the value of stat, you’ll see the test after Question 1 pass, but the test at the end of the notebook fail. Make sure to avoid using the same variable name for more than one purpose. Why does a notebook test fail now, when it passed before and I didn’t change my code? . You probably ran your notebook out of order. Re-run all previous cells in order, which is how your code will be graded. Why did a Gradescope test fail, when all the notebook’s tests passed? . This can happen if you’re running your notebook’s cells out-of-order. The autograder runs your notebook top-to-bottom. If you’re defining a variable at the bottom of your notebook and using it at the top, the Gradescope autograder will fail because it doesn’t recognize the variable when it encounters it. Additionally, this can fail if youhave not saved before you run the autograder. Ensure you select File -&gt; Save Notebook to avoid this. This is why we recommend running Kernel -&gt; Restart and Run All: it “forgets” all of the variables and runs the notebook from top-to-bottom, just like the Gradescope autograder will. This will highlight any issues. Find the first cell that raises an error. Make sure that all of the variables used in that cell have been defined above that cell, and not below. Why do I get an error saying grader is not defined? . If it has been a while since you’ve worked on an assignment, the kernel will shut itself down to preserve memory. When this happens, all of your variables are forgotten, including the grader. That’s OK: you’ll just need to re-run all of the cells. The easiest way to do this is by using Kernel -&gt; Restart and Run All. This may also occur if you never ran the top cell of the notebook where the grader is defined. I’m positive I have the right answer, but the test fails. Is there a mistake in the test? . While you might see the correct answer displayed as the result of the cell, chances are it isn’t being stored in the answer variable. Make sure you are assigning the result to the answer variable. Make sure there are no typos in the variable name. I accidentally deleted something in a cell that was provided to me – how do I get it back? . There are two solutions: . | In this public GitHub repository, you’ll find the “original” versions of all assignments we released this quarter. You can look here and manually add back any necessary code or text that you accidentally deleted. | Suppose you’re working on Lab 5. One solution is go directly to DataHub and rename your lab05 folder to something else, like lab05-old. Then, click the Lab 5 link on the course website again, and it’ll bring you to a brand-new version of Lab 5. Then, you can copy your work from your old Lab 5 to this new one, which should have everything in it. | . ",

    "title": "Specific Errors",
    "content": "A general rule of thumb when debugging is to look at the very last line of an error message. That’s usually the most informative part of the message, and will often tell you directly what’s wrong. … object is not callable . This often happens when you use a default keyword (like str or list) as a variable name, for instance list = [1, 2, 3]. These errors can be tricky because they don’t error on their own, but cause problems when we try to use the name list (for example) later on in the notebook. To fix the issue, identify any such lines of code, change your variable names to be something else, and restart your notebook. Python keywords like str and list appear in green text, so be on the lookout if any of your variable names appear in green! . SyntaxError at the very beginning of a line of code . Python expected you to continue your last line of code. Typically this means you have mismatched parentheses on the line above the line that is erroring. ",

My notebook won’t load. Is DataHub down? . Sometimes DataHub does have availability issues. Usually it is back up and running again within an hour. In other instances, there are some things you can do to get the notebook running again: Make sure your internet connection is working. If you can, restart your server by clicking the button at the top right labeled “Control Panel”, then select “Stop My Server”, followed by “Start My Server”. If that doesn’t work, try restarting your computer and using a different browser. Whenever you resume working on a notebook, run all cells you’ve previously completed. If your problem persists after trying all these steps, please notify us on Ed. What if I don’t have access to DataHub and I still want to access Data 8 materials? .

    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "content": ". Q: What is the best way to get help in this course? . A: Your best avenues are to go to office hours held by the course staff, or to ask questions on Ed. Course staff will be monitoring Ed frequently and will try to answer your question quickly and thoroughly. Q: Where will our grades for assignments be displayed for the course? . A: Grades will be displayed on Gradescope for the written and autograded portions for all assignments (homeworks, labs, projects, and exams). For homeworks and projects, your total grade is the sum of the autograded portion and the written portion. Q: I passed all the tests when doing my homework/project, but still got points off on the autograded portion of the assignment. Why is this happening? . A: The homeworks and projects have hidden tests that are not visible to students while they do the assignment. In order to pass these hidden tests, you must test your code yourself and make sure your answer is correct. Our tests are not always comprehensive. Q: I have a 0 on Gradescope for a lab that I attended and got checked off. Why is this? . A: Your attendance may have been marked incorrectly. Please contact your lab TA. Q: I worked with a partner on a project, and they have a grade on Gradescope for the project while I do not. Why is this happening? . A: You were likely not added to the Gradescope submission. Have your partner add you to both the written work and autograder submission immediately and contact your lab TA. Q: I noticed a mistake in the grading of the written portion of my homework. How can I get this fixed? . A: To get this fixed, you must submit a regrade request via Gradescope before the regrade deadline. This is known as the regrade request window. We unfortunately will not accept any regrades after the window has closed. All regrade deadline dates are posted on the same Ed post that releases the assignment grades and solutions. Q: I have some other grading questions. Who should I contact? . A: Please contact your lab GSI. Q: I would like to apply for a (u)GSI position for this course. What should I do? . A: All applications for Academic Student Employee positions are managed centrally; you can find all the details here. Please do not email the instructors individually with your resume/etc, as they are not in a position to hire you. ",

    "content": "Course Description . Foundations of Data Science combines three perspectives: inferential thinking, computational thinking, and real-world relevance. Given data arising from some real-world phenomenon, how does one analyze that data so as to understand that phenomenon? The course teaches critical concepts and skills in computer programming and statistical inference, in conjunction with hands-on analysis of real-world datasets, including economic data, document collections, geographical data, and social networks. It also delves into social issues surrounding data analysis such as privacy and study design. Prerequisites . The curriculum and format is designed specifically for students who have not previously taken statistics or computer science courses. Students with some prior experience in either statistics or computing are welcome to enroll and often find that this course offers a new perspective that blends computational and inferential thinking. Students who have taken several statistics or computer science courses should instead take a more advanced course like Data 100. Materials &amp; Resources . Our primary text is an online book called Computational and Inferential Thinking: The Foundations of Data Science. This text was written for the course by the course instructors. A complete PDF of the textbook can be found in the Student Materials Google Drive. The computing platform for the course is hosted at data8.datahub.berkeley.edu. Students find it convenient to use their own computer for the course. If you do not have adequate access to a personal computer, we can help you borrow a machine; please contact data8@berkeley.edu. Support . You are not alone in this course; the staff and instructors are here to support you as you learn the material. It’s expected that some aspects of the course will take time to master, and the best way to master challenging material is to ask questions. For questions, use Ed. We will also hold in-person office hours that offer drop-in help on assignments and course material. Your lab TA will be your main point of contact for all course related questions/grade clarifications. The TAs are here to support you so please lean on your lab TA if you need more support in the class or have any questions/concerns. Small-group tutoring sessions will be available for students in need of additional support to develop confidence with core concepts. In past semesters, students who attended have found these sessions to be a great use of their time. Details about sign-ups will be available a few weeks into the term. ",

    "content": "Live Lecture . Live lectures will be held from Monday to Thursday from 11:10am-12pm, and on Friday from 11:10am-1pm in Dwinelle 155; students are expected to attend live lectures synchronously due to the fast pace of the summer. Recordings of these sessions will be provided within 1-2 days of the lecture. Slides and lecture examples will be provided on the course website. Labs . This course has two 2-hour labs per week, held on Mondays and Wednesdays. All students are required to attend the first lab section, on Monday 6/17. If you are unable to attend the first lab section, please reach out to your assigned TA once you receive your section assignment. Weekly labs include a discussion worksheet covering recent material and a programming-based lab assignment that develops skills with computational and inferential concepts. Lab assignments will be released on the same day as they are due. We guarantee that all lab assignments will be released before the first lab section. This summer, lab meetings are two hours long on Monday and Wednesday. The first hour focuses on the discussion worksheet and group problem solving. The second hour is dedicated to completing the programming-based lab assignment. To receive credit for lab, you must attend both parts. If you complete the lab assignment before the lab period is over and get checked off by the course staff, you may leave early and still receive credit. If you stay for the complete lab period, make significant progress on the lab assignment, and get checked off by the course staff, you will receive full credit for the lab even if you haven’t completed the whole lab assignment. You must submit your lab notebook to Gradescope. You will receive full credit for the lab assignment if you are checked off and you submit. Your GSI will only check you off if you have either finished the lab notebook or worked until the end of the lab and made substantial progress. Lab sessions will not be recorded and are only offered in-person. Homework and Projects . Bi-weekly homework assignments are a required part of the course. You must complete and submit your homework independently, but you are allowed to discuss problems with other students and course staff. See the Learning Cooperatively section below. Homeworks will be released on Tuesday and Friday, and are due that same Friday and the following Tuesday night, respectively. Data science is about analyzing real-world data sets, and so you will also complete two projects involving real data. On each project, you may work with a single partner; your partner must be from the lab you enrolled in. Both partners will receive the same score. If you submit a homework or project 24 hours before the deadline or earlier, you will receive 5 bonus points on that assignment. Exams . The midterm exam will be held on Friday, July 12 from 11am-1pm PT. Please note the date and time carefully. The final exam is required for a passing grade, and will be held on Wednesday, August 7 from 11am-1pm PT. There will be no alternate exams for the midterm and the final exam for those with exam conflicts. If you have exam accommodations on file with the DSP office, they will be taken into account for both the midterm and final exams. ",

    "title": "Grades",
    "content": "Grades will be assigned using the following weighted components. Every assignment is weighted equally in its category. For example, there are 2 projects, so each project is worth (20 / 2)% = 10% of your grade. | Activity | Grade | . | Lab Credit | 10% | . | Homeworks | 20% | . | Projects | 20% | . | Midterm | 20% | . | Final | 30% | . | EPA | 2% [Extra Credit] | . Instructors not TA’s will respond to any questions regarding grade bins or letter grades. Extra Credit: Engagement, Participation and Attendance (EPA) . Extra credit participation points were created to encourage people to be good academic citizens, in a way that traditional grades could not capture. This can help boost you over a grade boundary if you’re close to one. Scoring is confidential, and your score will not be shared - please do not ask staff members any questions about this. You may demonstrate your engagement in Data 8 through attendance and participation during live lecture, lab section, office hours, and EdStem. For example, actively asking / answering questions during lecture will help you accumulate extra points in this category. Additionally, there are several ways to engage with the course staff: lab sections, tutoring sections, and office hours. At the end of the semester, your participation in these section activities will be scored according to attendance and engagement. The best way to score full points in this section is to attend your lab section/lecture, sign up for tutoring, and make sure your TA knows your name! . The maximum number of extra credit percentage points you can accumulate throughout the semester is 2%. Regrades . Grades for Homeworks, Projects, and Labs will be posted on Gradescope after the assignment’s due date. Solutions to the assignment and common mistakes will also be posted on Ed. It is up to you to check the solutions and request a regrade request before the regrade deadline (typically 5 days after grade release). Regrade requests can be made on Gradescope. Any regrade request past the deadline will not be looked at; this is to enforce the same deadline across all students, so please do not delay in reviewing your work. For the midterm exam, there will be a regrade request submission window. Please review the solutions and common mistakes before submitting a regrade request. Requests where a rubric item was incorrectly selected or not selected will be reviewed, but any regrade requests that ask to change the rubric or for partial credit will be ignored. ",

    "content": "Submitting Assignments . All assignments (homework, labs, and projects) will be submitted on Gradescope. Please refer to this tutorial for submitting assignments. Late Submission . The deadline for all assignments in this course is 11 PM PT. Assignments submitted until 11:59 PM on the day of the deadline will not be marked as late. Homework and lab submissions after this time will not be accepted. We understand that life happens. For this reason, your two lowest homework scores and two lowest lab scores will be dropped in the calculation of your overall grade. If you have an ongoing situation that prevents you from completing course content, please contact your lab TA. Projects will be accepted up to 2 days (48 hours) late. Projects submitted fewer than 24 hours after the deadline will receive 2/3 credit, and projects submitted between 24 and 48 hours after the deadline will receive 1/3 credit. Projects submitted 48 hours or more after the deadline will receive no credit. Assignment Extensions . Due to the fast pace of the summer offering, we are unable to offer assignment extensions for the vast majority of students. As mentioned above, you are provided two lab and homework drops for emergency situations that may come up. Only after using all your assignment drops, if you continue to encounter further emergencies beyond your control, please do not hesitate to reach out. Please fill out the Extenuating Circumstances Form, and a course staff member will reach out to you and provide a space for conversation, as well as to arrange accommodations as necessary. Note that you will be asked to provide supporting documentation, and these requests will be approved on a case-by-case basis. Learning Cooperatively . We encourage you to discuss course content with your friends and classmates as you are working on your assignments. No matter your academic background, you will learn more if you work alongside others than if you work alone. Ask questions, answer questions, and share ideas liberally. If some emergency takes you away from the course for an extended period, or if you decide to drop the course for any reason, please don’t just disappear silently! You should inform your lab TA and your project partner (if you have one) immediately, so that nobody is expecting you to do something you can’t finish. ",

    "content": "You must write your answers in your own words, and you must not share your completed work. The exception to this rule is that you can share everything related to a project with your project partner (if you have one) and turn in one project between the two of you, and if you are attending a lab session and have a lab partner you can share everything related to that lab with your lab partner. Make a serious attempt at every assignment yourself. If you get stuck, read the textbook and go over the lectures and lab discussion. After that, go ahead and discuss any remaining doubts with others, especially the course staff. That way you will get the most out of the discussion. It is important to keep in mind the limits to collaboration. As noted above, you and your friends are encouraged to discuss course content and approaches to problem solving. But you are not allowed to share your code or answers with other students. Doing so is considered academic misconduct, and it doesn’t help them either. It sets them up for trouble on upcoming assignments and on the exams. In addition, posting course content such as homeworks, projects, and exams on any 3rd party websites or submitting your own answers on outside sites/forums is considered academic misconduct. You are also not permitted to turn in answers or code that you have obtained from others. Not only does such copying count as academic misconduct, it circumvents the pedagogical goals of an assignment. You must solve problems with the resources made available in the course. You should never look at or have in your possession solutions from another student or another semester. Please read Berkeley’s Code of Conduct carefully. Penalties for academic misconduct in Data 8 are severe and include reporting to the Center for Student Conduct. They might also include a F in the course or even dismissal from the university. It’s just not worth it! . When you need help, reach out to the course staff using Ed, in office hours, and/or during labs. You are not alone in Data 8! Instructors and staff are here to help you succeed. We expect that you will work with integrity and with respect for other members of the class, just as the course staff will work with integrity and with respect for you. Finally, know that it’s normal to struggle. Berkeley has high standards, which is one of the reasons its degrees are valued. Everyone struggles even though many try not to show it. Even if you don’t learn everything that’s being covered, you’ll be able to build on what you do learn, whereas if you cheat you’ll have nothing to build on. You aren’t expected to be perfect; it’s ok not to get an A. ",
